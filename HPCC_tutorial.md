##Accessing the HPCC at Michigan State

###Windows users
Open Mobaxterm.
On the top left, click the "Session" tab, and on the popup menu right under it, click "new session". 
Again on the very top left on this new window, click "SSH". 
Under "basic SSH settings", enter into the "remote host" window:
`` 
hpcc.msu.edu
``
Check the box for "specity username", and input your netID. Now click "ok" at the bottom of the screen. 
After a few seconds, it will prompt you for your password. Enter the password and hit the enter key. *NOTE: nothing will show up on the screen as you type. That's ok. Just type your password as normal.


###Mac users
Open a session of Terminal.
Input the command
``
ssh [your netID]@hpcc.msu.edu
```
Enter your password when prompted.

##Congratulations! You've accessed the HPCC!

###What now?
Now that you are on the HPCC, you'll be using command line to navigate folders (called directories) and files.
